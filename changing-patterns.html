            A number of Tocumwal house residents took up the opportunities offered over the years to buy the house they were renting from the Government. Others moved on without buying. By the 1970s there was a mixture of private and Government ownership in the Tocumwal precinct. There was also a mixture of long term residents, some of whom now owned their houses, and newer ones. In 1973, when most of the public service transfer was complete, access to government housing in the ACT, as with other states and territories, became subject to a means test. This meant that families experiencing some income hardship and pensioners were the retainers or newer residents of the government-owned houses. Buyers were often people who worked nearby, perhaps at the Australian National University or the CSIRO. The Tocumwals also attracted people interested in alternative politics and lifestyles and were becoming popular as private rentals in the new era of group houses. The Co-op School , initially an alternative school, was established in the 1970s as was the Finn Street Family Centre. The Family Centre was established as a support centre for unemployed workers and their families. In the 1990s many residents were watching the move to dual occupancies and the higher prices of inner north real estate warily.

            </h6>
          <p>
            We were given the keys to the place on the 8th August 1979. This was about two or three months after I'd put my name down on the list and I'd been told that I'd have to wait for eight months or a year and a half, so I thought there was something a little unusual about it. When I came and looked at the place I could see why because it was kind of old and shabby and it wasn't the kind of place that a lot of people would like but I thought it would be great because we like to decorate the walls. I've lived in new houses and with small children in new houses you've got be constantly on their backs about keeping this and that clean and not bumping this and that. I'd rather live in an older house and let them be a bit more creative and free. So I said, 'Yes, this house'll suit me fine'.
</p>
          <p>My youngest child was one year old when we moved in. The others were from ten and a half up. There were seven of us all together. We came over the night I got the key - the husband of one of the teachers at Middle School, which was between the Co-ooperative School at O'Connor and the School Without Walls, brought us all over - and we looked around it with candles because the electricity wasn't on. I remember we put the candles in the place and then, because we were musicians, we sat down and played music.</p>

          <p>
            I remember sitting on the front porch and thinking very sadly about the garden where we'd been because it was beautiful, but I suddenly thought 'Hey, this is a great opportunity'. I was interested in permaculture and my family had been organic gardeners all along, so I just thought , 'Right, this isn't a sad thing to come here, this is an opportunity'. Whenever I had a few spare dollars I'd buy another tree and plant it and I moved around the things that were here. It took years before it really looked that good but I made those planting beds so that it wasn't all grass and planted stawberries as a ground cover and planted fruit trees and nut trees. We've got a big garden in the back as well.

</p>
<p>The personnel in this household changes all the time. People move away and move back again. We've got family all over the country really. That's been one thing that is really good, as a reasonably poor parent, to at least be able to say, 'Well, if you need a place to go you are welcome to come back here'. And there've been times when we've had children of friends staying here over a period of time. At the moment it's only Vandy, my oldest daughter and her four year old daughter and myself.
