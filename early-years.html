          <p>
            The new and growing population of Canberra included construction workers and workers in a wide range of service industries as well as transferred public servants. People from all these groups were on the Government housing list and when houses like the Tocumwals became available, getting somewhere to live was generally more important than location or style of house. The old Canberra hierarchies of status and position were not evident in the early years of the Tocumwal houses.</div>

            <h6>The first to be handed over</h6>
          <p>
            "We moved into Hart Street in November 1948. I was in hospital with my first born, then my husband was offered the house. He was questioned why he needed a four-bedroomed house with just one child and his reply was 'future developments' - which proved to be right as we subsequently had eight children. Our house was the first to be handed over and we were really pioneering. There was a small creek bed running through the back of the block, so much rock had to be dug out before a garden could be contemplated. We moved from there to Palmerston in April 1992 as the house and garden were becoming too much for us to manage as the children had all married and left home.</p>
          <p>It wasn't until some time in the 50s before the road was sealed and kerbs and guttering completed. I well remember the dust and heat on that occasion, not to mention the noise.</p>
          <p>
            The 'paddock' at the top of the street was a great place for the children of the street - which were quite a lot - to get together, kick a football, ride their bikes and my sons tell me 'meeting girls'. We had quite a few bonfires there on Cracker Night and the general community feeling was one of friendliness.
<p> We made some improvements to our house, removing the large fireplace structure and the fuel stove in the kitchen in the 60s. Also having the outside of the house clad with artificial tile around the same time, although we see that the present owner removed this and it is once again the original fibro and weatherboard structure.</p>

          <p>
            Transported by father-in-law in his Jaguar our family arrived at Block 5 section 36, O'Connor. No street, footpath or hedge. We drove directly to the front steps to unload our gear. Furniture was already in place. I had been living for a short time at Adaminaby with my parents, with two children and pregnant - until our house became available.
</p>
          <p>The area which later became Peel Street was occupied by builders' huts and pools of water while the houses on the eastern side were completed. North of Macarthur Avenue was a farm occupied by Mrs. Shumack. Sheep roamed about where the O'Connor tennis courts now stand.

          </p>

          <p>
            It seemed to rain for weeks and the area was a mass of yellow mud. As more houses were completed and familes arrived - most with small children - we became a close knit community.
          </p>

          <p>Few had cars - we walked to Civic to shop. Groceries were delivered by the Civic shops. A greengrocer called in the street weekly - â€˜fresh food people' - in a truck.

          <h6>'Good luck with the rocks, Bruce!'</h3>
          <p>
            It rained a lot in that winter and the mud and dampness was a worry to everyone. Our driveway became an absolute bog and so Bruce contacted the Works Department about some kind of help with our drive. I might add that Canberra was only a small place in those days and mostly everyone knew or knew of, one another. Our request was granted. A large load of rocks was delivered to our driveway - as too was a sledgehammer with a little note from someone in the department with a great sense of humour - 'Good luck with the rocks Bruce'!! So much for knowing someone in the Works Department.
