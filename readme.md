# 11056 Front-end Web Design

## RATIONALE

RESPONSIVE LAYOUT
My final website achieves a seamless responsive layout that was carefully considered to appear easily readable on desktop as well as mobile. Image placement and size, header scaling, amount of text, and white space all affect the viewing experience of the user. Each was individually tweaked using media queries depending on the screen width. some elements have been omitted for mobile use including the previous page button and the navigation bar

SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES
I found it difficult to make the hero text parallax effect, there were frequent errors in the form of page gaps, static elements, or incorrectly scaled text. The prev/next buttons were another pain point as I had never added svgs to a text and I had trouble customising the hover animation. Once I had coded the first page, it was really easy to copy the formatting to the other pages, and only have to change the content. The masonry grid was also very intuitive, I had assumed it would be more convoluted.

AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT
I opted for a modest and straight forward design aesthetic, to allow intuitive accessibility and to preserve the authenticity and cultural significance of the site's historical content, however I feel the site could have benefited from some unique design features to give it some character. I would have liked to have added title and location information to the images in the collection page, by having a label that follows the cursor. There are some margins and padding within the content that could be adjusted to balance the spacing. In terms of the code itself, much of it could benefit from simplification and tidying (I had issues with prettier, apologies). The footer is pretty basic and could be improved with some contact links socials, or even a sources page link

## PROTOTYPE CHANGES

My final site follows the same general layout and aesthetic of my prototypes, although a few elements have been adjusted:

I added header text to give the home page more appeal.

I opted for full width image containers to put some emphasis on the visuals.

I decided not to include a contents dropdown menu as shown in my prototype. I think the site may benefit from this feature, but it is still easy to navigate nonetheless.

I reformatted the footer, giving an improved and simplified hierarchy.

For the collections page, I made the images extend full width and tightened the margins, eliminating the unnecessary black space.

I changed the font size and weight of the subheading to display better on desktop and mobile.

I dispersed the images throughout the pages to break up the long passages of text.

## USE OF GEN AI

I used ChatGPT as tool to assist in solving complex coding issues, to teach me unknown coding processes, and for tasks that were beyond the scope of the assignment.

It helped to troubleshoot errors in my code which would be difficult to locate manually.

I learnt ways of coding that i wasn't familiar with like changing svg properties, adding a vignette, and creating a parallax effect, and javascript transitions and animations

_I've only made comments in index.html and style.css (other pages are essentially the same)_
