Responsive site design

My final website achieves a seamless responsive layout that works on screens of various sizes,

LAYOUT
the layout of the pages was carefully considered to appear easily readable on desktop as well as mobile. Image placement and size, header scaling, amount of text, and white space all affect the viewing experience of the user. Each was individually tweaked using media queries depending on the screen width. some elements have been omitted for mobile use including the previous page button and the navigation bar

SUCESSES AND CHALLENGES
I found it difficult to do the hero text parallax effect

AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT
I opted for a modest and straight forward design aesthetic, to allow intuitive accesibility and to preserve the authenticity and cultural significance of the sites historical content, however I feel the site could have benefited from some unique design features to give it some character.

My final site doesn't include a contents dropdown menu as shown in my prototype. I think the site would benefit from this feature, but it is still easy to navigate nonetheless.

I would have liked to have added title and location information to the images in the collecion page, potentially by clicking each image.

include your prototypes and discuss how they were/were not implemented

Can you look at your own work critically, recognising both your strengths and areas for potential improvement?
Does your rationale demonstrate critical self-reflection, discussing both successes and challenges?
Have you explicitly connected your design and development decisions to concepts covered in the unit?

USE OF GEN AI

I used ChatGPT as tool to assist in solving complex coding issues, to teach me unknown coding processes, and for tasks that were beyond the scope of the assignment.

It helped to troubleshoot errors in my code which would be difficult to locate manually.

I learnt ways of coding that i wasn't familiar with like changing svg properties, adding a vignette, and creating a parallax effect, and javascript transitions and animations

\*I've only made comments in index.html and style.css (other pages are essentially the same)
